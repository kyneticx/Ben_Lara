Very Simple and self explanatory to use - Initialise program will be the only 
option available until you have setup a program - once you do that the button
will change to reset and the add button and menu item will be enabled. 

Clicking the add or reset/initialise button will present an input dialog which 
you can cancel at anytime - if you hit ok input validation will be performed and 
any errors detected will be output as messages to a new dialog box asking you 
to enter them again.

To remove a program you must first select one of the courses in the in the 
program map - when you have selected a course its border will be highlighted in
red - you can deselect the course by clicking it again or directly select 
another course which will deselect the one currently selected. Once you have
selected a course the remove button will be enabled enabling you to remove the
course.

Have a nice day! :D
